# leaflet2-challenge
challenge 15
created the url 
called d3.json
created the map function with base layers, earthquake layers
along with legend, colordept etc. 

I had lot of issues with the errors.  I called the TA - they were not able to help me. 
the first TA said my file was corrupt.  So I endup starting with a brand new repo. 
I asked my teacher but, we endup not with enough class time.  I did fix one area that she spoted, but still having errors.
